Stock exchanges compete for order flow through their fee models. A traditional model pays 
rebates to liquidity suppliers, and an inverted model pays rebates to liquidity demanders. 
Using a regulatory intervention to examine the interaction between tick size, restrictions 
on dark trading, and exchange fees, we show that traders use inverted venues to adjust for 
suboptimal tick sizes. Increased inverted venue activity improves pricing efficiency and 
liquidity, especially when the tick size is binding. We show that the sub-tick price 
improvement offered by inverted venues enhances competition for liquidity provision and 
increases information impounded into prices through nonmarketable limit orders.

In an effort to increase transparency, the chair of the Federal Reserve now holds a 
press conference (PC) following some, but not all, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
announcements. Evidence from financial markets shows that investors lower their expectations 
of important decisions on days without PCs and that these announcements convey less 
price-relevant information. Correspondingly, we show that investors pay more attention 
to upcoming announcements with PCs. This coordination of attention can reduce welfare 
in models of the social value of public information. Consistent with theories of 
investor attention, the market risk premium is larger on days with PCs.

*Note:* From January 2019, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve will `now hold a press conference after each meeting <https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/feds-powell-says-he-will-begin-press-conferences-following-each-meeting-starting-in-january.html>`__.

**Price Revelation from Insider Trading: Evidence from Hacked Earnings News**

With `Pat Akey <http://patakeyfinance.com>`__ and `Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

[`Available on SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3365024>`__]

From 2010-2015, a group of convicted traders accessed earnings information hours before 
their public release by hacking several major newswire services. We use their ''insider'' 
trading as a natural experiment to investigate how efficiently markets incorporate 
private information in prices. 15% of a firm's earnings surprise was incorporated 
into its stock price prior to its public release when the hackers had access to 
non-public information. Volume and spread-based measures of informed trading detect 
this activity, but order flow-based measures do not. We find evidence that uninformed, 
professional traders traded in the same direction, amplifying the impact of informed 
trading.

**How is Earnings News Transmitted to Stock Prices?**

With `Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

[`SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3060094>`__]
[`Online Appendix <https://www.dropbox.com/s/9vjq9a2ge7vfoid/After_Hours_Appendix_v3.pdf?dl=0>`__]

The most anticipated firms' disclosures are often released in the after-hours market, 
a very illiquid trading environment. We examine the relationship between liquidity 
and market efficiency around earnings announced outside of regular trading hours. 
We find that price discovery of earnings surprises occurs through changes in quotes 
rather than through trades. Pre-announcement bid-ask spreads are wide enough to 
eliminate profits of informed liquidity-takers. Spreads narrow following announcements 
but do so asymmetrically. Ask (bid) prices adjust quickly and efficiently to reflect 
positive (negative) surprises while bid (ask) prices are slower to adjust. This 
asymmetry generates price drifts in midquotes. Our results suggest that using midquotes 
to examine market efficiency in illiquid markets underestimates the true speed of 
price discovery. 


**Double Bonus? Implicit Incentives for Money Managers with Explicit incentives**

With `Juan Sotes-Paladino <https://sites.google.com/site/jmsotespaladino/home>`__

[`SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2980599>`__]

We use a unique dataset of European performance-fee mutual funds to examine the 
interaction between explicit incentives (performance fees) and implicit incentives
(fund flows) of asset managers. Funds with performance fees can face substantially 
steeper implicit incentives compared to non-performance-fee funds. Among 
performance-fee funds, investorsâ€™ flows depend on the performance fee level and 
tend to attenuate the asymmetry in the total pay for performance of higher-fee 
funds. Thus, the investor preferences that we elicit favor performance-sensitive 
but not necessarily asymmetric compensation schedules for fund companies. Our 
results shed new light on several aspects of the contracting problem in asset 
delegation.

**Do Mutual Fund Managers Adjust NAV for Stale Prices?**

[`SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928321>`__]

Mutual fund returns are predictable when the Net Asset Value is computed from
prices that do not reflect all available information. This problem was brought
to the public eye with the late trading and market timing scandal of 2003,
which led to SEC intervention in 2004. Since these events, mutual fund managers
have been more active in adjusting NAV, reducing predictability by about half.
The simple trading strategy I present yields annual returns of 33% from 2001 to
2004 and 16% from 2005 to 2010. Even after accounting for trading restrictions
in mutual funds, an arbitrager could earn annual returns of 2.73% from 2005 to
2010, suggesting the problem is not fully resolved. The main methodological
contribution of this paper is to develop a filtering approach based on a
state-space model that embeds the fund manager problem, thus accounting for
unobserved actions of fund managers. I also show that predictability increases
significantly when information sources suggested by prior literature, such as
index and futures returns, are supplemented by premiums on related exchange
traded funds).

**Indexers and Comovement**

[`SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2308695>`__]
[`Online Appendix </research-files/indexers_appendix.pdf>`__]

I introduce a general equilibrium model with active investors and indexers.
Indexing causes market segmentation, and the degree of segmentation is a
function of the relative wealth of indexers in the economy. Shocks to this
relative wealth induce correlated shocks to discount rates of index stocks.
The wealthier indexers are, the greater the resulting comovement is. I confirm
empirically that S&P 500 stocks comove more with other index stocks and less
with non-index stocks, and that changes in passive holdings of S&P 500 stocks
predict changes in comovement of index stocks.
