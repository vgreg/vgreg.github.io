**How is Earnings News Transmitted to Stock Prices?**

With `Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

[`Available on SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3060094>`__]

We study price formation around earnings announcements for S&P 1500 stocks from 2011 to 2015 
to understand the relationship between liquidity and price efficiency. Earnings are announced 
in the after-hours market, an illiquid trading environment with low trading volume. Spreads 
are wider before announcements and narrow more slowly after announcements for small firms. 
The narrowing of spreads is driven by one side of the quote as ask (bid) prices update 
instantaneously after positive (negative) news. On average, pre-announcement spreads include 
the post-announcement midquote, leaving no profits for liquidity traders other than trading 
against stale quotes. Midquote prices fully reflect earnings surprises before the opening of
markets even if there are no trades.

**Double Bonus? Implicit Incentives for Money Managers with Explicit incentives**

With `Juan Sotes-Paladino <https://sites.google.com/site/jmsotespaladino/home>`__

Using a unique dataset of performance-fee mutual funds, we examine the
interaction between direct and indirect incentives in the asset management
industry. A comparison of the flow-performance relationships of performance-fee
and non-performance-fee funds reveals that funds with direct incentives can face
substantially steeper indirect incentives. Among performance-fee funds, the flow
relationship depends on the performance fee level and tends to attenuate the
asymmetry in total pay for good vs. poor performance. Altogether, our findings
suggest that the market favors steep but symmetric ("linear") compensation
schedules for asset managers. Our results shed new light on the contracting
relation between delegating investors and their portfolio managers.

**Do Mutual Fund Managers Adjust NAV for Stale Prices?**

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928321>`__]

Mutual fund returns are predictable when the Net Asset Value is computed from
prices that do not reflect all available information. This problem was brought
to the public eye with the late trading and market timing scandal of 2003,
which led to SEC intervention in 2004. Since these events, mutual fund managers
have been more active in adjusting NAV, reducing predictability by about half.
The simple trading strategy I present yields annual returns of 33% from 2001 to
2004 and 16% from 2005 to 2010. Even after accounting for trading restrictions
in mutual funds, an arbitrager could earn annual returns of 2.73% from 2005 to
2010, suggesting the problem is not fully resolved. The main methodological
contribution of this paper is to develop a filtering approach based on a
state-space model that embeds the fund manager problem, thus accounting for
unobserved actions of fund managers. I also show that predictability increases
significantly when information sources suggested by prior literature, such as
index and futures returns, are supplemented by premiums on related exchange
traded funds).

**Indexers and Comovement**

Revise and resubmit, Financial Management

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2308695>`__]
[`Online Appendix </research-files/indexers_appendix.pdf>`__]

I introduce a general equilibrium model with active investors and indexers.
Indexing causes market segmentation, and the degree of segmentation is a
function of the relative wealth of indexers in the economy. Shocks to this
relative wealth induce correlated shocks to discount rates of index stocks.
The wealthier indexers are, the greater the resulting comovement is. I confirm
empirically that S&P 500 stocks comove more with other index stocks and less
with non-index stocks, and that changes in passive holdings of S&P 500 stocks
predict changes in comovement of index stocks.
