Working Papers
==============


How is Earnings News Transmitted to Stock Prices?
-------------------------------------------------

With `Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

[`Available on SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3060094>`__]

We study price formation around earnings announcements for S&P 1500 stocks from 2011 to
2015 using high-frequency, order-level data. We find that price discovery takes place
in the after-hours market and is complete before the opening auction, or by 10 a.m. for
stocks that have no after-hours trades. Initial price reactions occur upon the arrival
of the first trades and are explained by earnings surprises, not by liquidity-taking
order flow, consistent with the theoretical view that news can incorporate prices
instantly. Moreover, sophisticated liquidity providers are active and profitable at 
that time. Despite fast price discovery, we find significant price drifts following 
big surprises in the after-hours market, which we relate to theoretical work on 
information processing.


Coordinating Attention: The Unintended Consequences of FOMC Press Conferences
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

With `Oliver Boguth <http://www.public.asu.edu/~oboguth/>`__ and

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2698477>`__]

In an effort to increase transparency, the Chair of the Federal Reserve now holds a press conference following some, but not all, Federal Open Market Committee announcements. Press conferences are scheduled independently of economic conditions and communicate little information. Evidence from financial markets demonstrates that investors lower their expectations of important decisions on days without press conferences and that these announcements convey less price-relevant information. Therefore, the addition of press conference probably decreased transparency. Moreover, we show that investors concentrate their attention on announcements with press conferences, which, in recent models of the social value of public information, can reduce welfare. 

Inverted Fee Venues and Market Quality
--------------------------------------

With `Carole Comerton-Forde <http://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person532357>`__ and

Stock exchanges incentivize the demand and supply of liquidity through their
fee models. A traditional model pays a rebate to the liquidity supplier and an
inverted model pays a rebate to liquidity demanders. We examine the impact of
inverted fee models on market quality using an exogenous shock to inverted
venue market share created by a regulatory intervention â€“ the 2016 Tick Size
Pilot. We show higher inverted venue share improves pricing efficiency,
increases liquidity and decreases volatility. Our findings suggest that the
finer pricing grid provided by inverted venues encourages competition between
liquidity providers and improves market quality.


Double Bonus? Implicit Incentives for Money Managers with Explicit Incentives
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With `Juan Sotes-Paladino <https://sites.google.com/site/jmsotespaladino/home>`__

[`Available on SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2980599>`__]

Using a unique dataset of performance-fee mutual funds, we examine the
interaction between direct and indirect incentives in the asset management
industry. A comparison of the flow-performance relationships of performance-fee
and non-performance-fee funds reveals that funds with direct incentives can face
substantially steeper indirect incentives. Among performance-fee funds, the flow
relationship depends on the performance fee level and tends to attenuate the
asymmetry in total pay for good vs. poor performance. Altogether, our findings
suggest that the market favors steep but symmetric ("linear") compensation
schedules for asset managers. Our results shed new light on the contracting
relation between delegating investors and their portfolio managers.

Do Mutual Fund Managers Adjust NAV for Stale Prices?
----------------------------------------------------

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928321>`__]

Mutual fund returns are predictable when the Net Asset Value is computed from
prices that do not reflect all available information. This problem was brought
to the public eye with the late trading and market timing scandal of 2003,
which led to SEC intervention in 2004. Since these events, mutual fund managers
have been more active in adjusting NAV, reducing predictability by about half.
The simple trading strategy I present yields annual returns of 33% from 2001 to
2004 and 16% from 2005 to 2010. Even after accounting for trading restrictions
in mutual funds, an arbitrager could earn annual returns of 2.73% from 2005 to
2010, suggesting the problem is not fully resolved. The main methodological
contribution of this paper is to develop a filtering approach based on a
state-space model that embeds the fund manager problem, thus accounting for
unobserved actions of fund managers. I also show that predictability increases
significantly when information sources suggested by prior literature, such as
index and futures returns, are supplemented by premiums on related exchange
traded funds).

Indexers and Comovement
-----------------------

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2308695>`__]
[`Online Appendix </research-files/indexers_appendix.pdf>`__]

I introduce a general equilibrium model with active investors and indexers.
Indexing causes market segmentation, and the degree of segmentation is a
function of the relative wealth of indexers in the economy. Shocks to this
relative wealth induce correlated shocks to discount rates of index stocks.
The wealthier indexers are, the greater the resulting comovement is. I confirm
empirically that S&P 500 stocks comove more with other index stocks and less
with non-index stocks, and that changes in passive holdings of S&P 500 stocks
predict changes in comovement of index stocks.
