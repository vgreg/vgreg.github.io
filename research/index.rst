Working Papers

How is Earnings News Transmitted to Stock Prices?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With `Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

[`Available on SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3060094>`__]

    We study price formation around earnings announcements for S&P 1500 stocks from 2011 to
    2015 using high-frequency, order-level data. We find that price discovery takes place
    in the after-hours market and is complete before the opening auction, or by 10 a.m. for
    stocks that have no after-hours trades. Initial price reactions occur upon the arrival
    of the first trades and are explained by earnings surprises, not by liquidity-taking
    order flow, consistent with the theoretical view that news can incorporate prices
    instantly. Moreover, sophisticated liquidity providers are active and profitable at 
    that time. Despite fast price discovery, we find significant price drifts following 
    big surprises in the after-hours market, which we relate to theoretical work on 
    information processing.

Inverted Fee Venues and Market Quality

    Stock exchanges compete for order flow through their fee models. A traditional model 
    pays a rebate to the liquidity supplier, and an inverted model pays a rebate to liquidity 
    demanders. We examine the impact of inverted fee models on market quality using an 
    exogenous shock to inverted venue market share created by a regulatory intervention, 
    the SEC Tick Size Pilot. We find that trading on inverted venues improves pricing 
    efficiency and liquidity when the minimum tick size is binding. We show that by 
    offering traders sub-tick price improvement, inverted fee venues enhance competition 
    for liquidity provision and increase information impounded into prices through 
    limit orders.


Shaping Expectations and Coordinating Attention: The Unintended Consequences of FOMC Press Conferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With `Oliver Boguth <http://www.public.asu.edu/~oboguth/>`__ and
`Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2698477>`__]

    In an effort to increase transparency, the Chair of the Federal Reserve now holds a press conference 
    following some, but not all, FOMC announcements. Evidence from financial markets shows that investors 
    lower their expectations of important decisions on days without press conferences and that these 
    announcements convey less price-relevant information. Using different proxies, we show that investors 
    pay more attention to upcoming announcements with press conferences. This coordination of attention 
    can reduce welfare in models of the social value of public information. Consistent with theories of 
    investor attention, the market risk premium is larger on days with press conferences. 


Double Bonus? Implicit Incentives for Money Managers with Explicit Incentives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With `Juan Sotes-Paladino <https://sites.google.com/site/jmsotespaladino/home>`__

[`Available on SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2980599>`__]

    Using a unique dataset of performance-fee mutual funds, we examine the
    interaction between direct and indirect incentives in the asset management
    industry. A comparison of the flow-performance relationships of performance-fee
    and non-performance-fee funds reveals that funds with direct incentives can face
    substantially steeper indirect incentives. Among performance-fee funds, the flow
    relationship depends on the performance fee level and tends to attenuate the
    asymmetry in total pay for good vs. poor performance. Altogether, our findings
    suggest that the market favors steep but symmetric ("linear") compensation
    schedules for asset managers. Our results shed new light on the contracting
    relation between delegating investors and their portfolio managers.

Do Mutual Fund Managers Adjust NAV for Stale Prices?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928321>`__]

    Mutual fund returns are predictable when the Net Asset Value is computed from
    prices that do not reflect all available information. This problem was brought
    to the public eye with the late trading and market timing scandal of 2003,
    which led to SEC intervention in 2004. Since these events, mutual fund managers
    have been more active in adjusting NAV, reducing predictability by about half.
    The simple trading strategy I present yields annual returns of 33% from 2001 to
    2004 and 16% from 2005 to 2010. Even after accounting for trading restrictions
    in mutual funds, an arbitrager could earn annual returns of 2.73% from 2005 to
    2010, suggesting the problem is not fully resolved. The main methodological
    contribution of this paper is to develop a filtering approach based on a
    state-space model that embeds the fund manager problem, thus accounting for
    unobserved actions of fund managers. I also show that predictability increases
    significantly when information sources suggested by prior literature, such as
    index and futures returns, are supplemented by premiums on related exchange
    traded funds).

Indexers and Comovement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[`Available on SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2308695>`__]
[`Online Appendix </research-files/indexers_appendix.pdf>`__]

    I introduce a general equilibrium model with active investors and indexers.
    Indexing causes market segmentation, and the degree of segmentation is a
    function of the relative wealth of indexers in the economy. Shocks to this
    relative wealth induce correlated shocks to discount rates of index stocks.
    The wealthier indexers are, the greater the resulting comovement is. I confirm
    empirically that S&P 500 stocks comove more with other index stocks and less
    with non-index stocks, and that changes in passive holdings of S&P 500 stocks
    predict changes in comovement of index stocks.
