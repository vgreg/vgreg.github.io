    .. admonition:: Price Revelation from Insider Trading: Evidence from Hacked Earnings News

        Revise and resubmit at *Journal of Financial Economics*

        With `Pat Akey <http://patakeyfinance.com>`__ and `Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

        [`Available on SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3365024>`__]

        From 2010-2015, a group of traders illegally accessed earnings information hours before their public release by 
        hacking several major newswire services. We use their informed trading as a natural experiment to investigate 
        how efficiently markets incorporate private information in trades. 15% of a firm’s earnings surprise was incorporated 
        into its stock price prior to its public release, when the hackers were trading. Their trading activity sharply 
        increased order flow, causing liquidity providers to charge higher spreads, consistent with classical models 
        of market microstructure. The increase in spreads was large enough to reduce the profitability of uniformed 
        trades, suggesting that informed trading can have adverse effects on financial markets.

    .. admonition:: How is Earnings News Transmitted to Stock Prices?

        Revise and resubmit at *Journal of Accounting Research*

        With `Charles Martineau <http://www.charlesmartineau.com>`__

        [`SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3060094>`__]

        Most corporate news occurs in the after-hours market, a very illiquid trading environment. 
        We examine the relationship between liquidity and price discovery around after-hours earnings 
        announcements. Prices reflect earnings surprises through changes in quotes rather than through 
        trades. Following announcements, ask (bid) prices adjust quickly to positive (negative) surprises 
        while bid (ask) prices are slower to adjust. Returns computed from trade prices underestimate the 
        speed and magnitude of price reactions following announcements relative to midquote returns. 
        These findings emphasize the importance of using quotes and not trade prices when studying 
        price discovery in the after-hours market. This is especially crucial when there are confounding 
        events, which we illustrate using analyst recommendation revisions. 


    .. admonition:: Double Bonus? Implicit Incentives for Money Managers with Explicit incentives

        With `Juan Sotes-Paladino <https://sites.google.com/site/jmsotespaladino/home>`__

        [`SSRN <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2980599>`__]

        We use a unique dataset of European performance-fee mutual funds to examine the 
        interaction between explicit incentives (performance fees) and implicit incentives
        (fund flows) of asset managers. Funds with performance fees can face substantially 
        steeper implicit incentives compared to non-performance-fee funds. Among 
        performance-fee funds, investors’ flows depend on the performance fee level and 
        tend to attenuate the asymmetry in the total pay for performance of higher-fee 
        funds. Thus, the investor preferences that we elicit favor performance-sensitive 
        but not necessarily asymmetric compensation schedules for fund companies. Our 
        results shed new light on several aspects of the contracting problem in asset 
        delegation.

    .. admonition:: Do Mutual Fund Managers Adjust NAV for Stale Prices?

        [`SSRN <http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928321>`__]

        Mutual fund returns are predictable when the Net Asset Value is computed from
        prices that do not reflect all available information. This problem was brought
        to the public eye with the late trading and market timing scandal of 2003,
        which led to SEC intervention in 2004. Since these events, mutual fund managers
        have been more active in adjusting NAV, reducing predictability by about half.
        The simple trading strategy I present yields annual returns of 33% from 2001 to
        2004 and 16% from 2005 to 2010. Even after accounting for trading restrictions
        in mutual funds, an arbitrager could earn annual returns of 2.73% from 2005 to
        2010, suggesting the problem is not fully resolved. The main methodological
        contribution of this paper is to develop a filtering approach based on a
        state-space model that embeds the fund manager problem, thus accounting for
        unobserved actions of fund managers. I also show that predictability increases
        significantly when information sources suggested by prior literature, such as
        index and futures returns, are supplemented by premiums on related exchange
        traded funds).
