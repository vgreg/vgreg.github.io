<p>Stock exchanges compete for order flow through their fee models. A traditional model pays
rebates to liquidity suppliers, and an inverted model pays rebates to liquidity demanders.
Using a regulatory intervention to examine the interaction between tick size, restrictions
on dark trading, and exchange fees, we show that traders use inverted venues to adjust for
suboptimal tick sizes. Increased inverted venue activity improves pricing efficiency and
liquidity, especially when the tick size is binding. We show that the sub-tick price
improvement offered by inverted venues enhances competition for liquidity provision and
increases information impounded into prices through nonmarketable limit orders.</p>

<p>In an effort to increase transparency, the chair of the Federal Reserve now holds a
press conference (PC) following some, but not all, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
announcements. Evidence from financial markets shows that investors lower their expectations
of important decisions on days without PCs and that these announcements convey less
price-relevant information. Correspondingly, we show that investors pay more attention
to upcoming announcements with PCs. This coordination of attention can reduce welfare
in models of the social value of public information. Consistent with theories of
investor attention, the market risk premium is larger on days with PCs.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> From January 2019, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve will <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/feds-powell-says-he-will-begin-press-conferences-following-each-meeting-starting-in-january.html">now hold a press conference after each meeting</a>.

<p><strong>Price Revelation from Insider Trading: Evidence from Hacked Earnings News</strong></p>
<p>With <a class="reference external" href="http://patakeyfinance.com">Pat Akey</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.charlesmartineau.com">Charles Martineau</a></p>

<p>From 2010-2015, a group of convicted traders accessed earnings information hours before
their public release by hacking several major newswire services. We use their ''insider''
trading as a natural experiment to investigate how efficiently markets incorporate
private information in prices. 15% of a firm's earnings surprise was incorporated
into its stock price prior to its public release when the hackers had access to
non-public information. Volume and spread-based measures of informed trading detect
this activity, but order flow-based measures do not. We find evidence that uninformed,
professional traders traded in the same direction, amplifying the impact of informed
trading.</p>

<p><strong>How is Earnings News Transmitted to Stock Prices?</strong></p>
<p>With <a class="reference external" href="http://www.charlesmartineau.com">Charles Martineau</a></p>

<p>The most anticipated firms' disclosures are often released in the after-hours market,
a very illiquid trading environment. We examine the relationship between liquidity
and market efficiency around earnings announced outside of regular trading hours.
We find that price discovery of earnings surprises occurs through changes in quotes
rather than through trades. Pre-announcement bid-ask spreads are wide enough to
eliminate profits of informed liquidity-takers. Spreads narrow following announcements
but do so asymmetrically. Ask (bid) prices adjust quickly and efficiently to reflect
positive (negative) surprises while bid (ask) prices are slower to adjust. This
asymmetry generates price drifts in midquotes. Our results suggest that using midquotes
to examine market efficiency in illiquid markets underestimates the true speed of
price discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bonus? Implicit Incentives for Money Managers with Explicit incentives</strong></p>
<p>With <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/jmsotespaladino/home">Juan Sotes-Paladino</a></p>
<p>[<a class="reference external" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2980599">SSRN</a>]</p>
<p>We use a unique dataset of European performance-fee mutual funds to examine the
interaction between explicit incentives (performance fees) and implicit incentives
(fund flows) of asset managers. Funds with performance fees can face substantially
steeper implicit incentives compared to non-performance-fee funds. Among
performance-fee funds, investors’ flows depend on the performance fee level and
tend to attenuate the asymmetry in the total pay for performance of higher-fee
funds. Thus, the investor preferences that we elicit favor performance-sensitive
but not necessarily asymmetric compensation schedules for fund companies. Our
results shed new light on several aspects of the contracting problem in asset
delegation.</p>
<p><strong>Do Mutual Fund Managers Adjust NAV for Stale Prices?</strong></p>
<p>[<a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928321">SSRN</a>]</p>
<p>Mutual fund returns are predictable when the Net Asset Value is computed from
prices that do not reflect all available information. This problem was brought
to the public eye with the late trading and market timing scandal of 2003,
which led to SEC intervention in 2004. Since these events, mutual fund managers
have been more active in adjusting NAV, reducing predictability by about half.
The simple trading strategy I present yields annual returns of 33% from 2001 to
2004 and 16% from 2005 to 2010. Even after accounting for trading restrictions
in mutual funds, an arbitrager could earn annual returns of 2.73% from 2005 to
2010, suggesting the problem is not fully resolved. The main methodological
contribution of this paper is to develop a filtering approach based on a
state-space model that embeds the fund manager problem, thus accounting for
unobserved actions of fund managers. I also show that predictability increases
significantly when information sources suggested by prior literature, such as
index and futures returns, are supplemented by premiums on related exchange
traded funds).</p>
<p><strong>Indexers and Comovement</strong></p>
<p>[<a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2308695">SSRN</a>]
[<a class="reference external" href="../research-files/indexers_appendix.pdf">Online Appendix</a>]</p>
<p>I introduce a general equilibrium model with active investors and indexers.
Indexing causes market segmentation, and the degree of segmentation is a
function of the relative wealth of indexers in the economy. Shocks to this
relative wealth induce correlated shocks to discount rates of index stocks.
The wealthier indexers are, the greater the resulting comovement is. I confirm
empirically that S&amp;P 500 stocks comove more with other index stocks and less
with non-index stocks, and that changes in passive holdings of S&amp;P 500 stocks
predict changes in comovement of index stocks.</p>
